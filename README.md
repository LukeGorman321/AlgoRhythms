Thank you! For choosing RecordRecs for your new music recommendations, built by us here at AlgoRhythms.

Before you get starting using our site, there are a few things to note:

1. DON'T use the website straight off of your downloaded ZIP folder, opened into a web browser.
   This can cause some of our dependencies to fail, leaving you with a broken expereience. (This is because of browser security concerns.)
   Instead, we recommend downloading our ZIP file, and using the main folder to run a Python Web Server, right on your machine.

   It's simple!

   Once downloaded, open the folder within your computer's terminal or command prompt, either using 'cd' or your operating system to do so.
   Once your terminal is open inside the folder, use " python3 -m http.server 8000 ". You're welcome to use any port (e.g. 8000) you like,
   it should work the same.

   Once the terminal tells you that it's "Serving HTTP", you're ready! Type in " localhost:8000 " to start using our site!

2. This is not a perfect product. If you find any program breaking bugs, please feel free to let us know at any of our developer emails.

3. Have fun!

We look forward to seeing you enjoy your favorite new songs!
